          <p className="mb-6">
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
            mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
            website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
            efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Best Websites
            Daytona) are called &quot;first party cookies&quot;. Cookies set by
            parties other than the website owner are called &quot;third party
            cookies&quot;. Third party cookies enable third party features or
            functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g.,
            advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that
            set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when
            it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain
            other websites.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
            Why do we use cookies?
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some
            cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website
            to operate, and we refer to these as &quot;essential&quot; or
            &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable us
            to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
            experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our
            website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.

            What types of cookies do we use and how do we use them?

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Essential website cookies:</strong> These cookies are
              strictly necessary to provide you with services available through
              our website and to use some of its features, such as access to
              secure areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Analytics and customization cookies:</strong> These
              cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form
              to help us understand how our website is being used or how
              effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our
              website for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advertising cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to
              make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform
              functions like preventing the same ad from continuously
              reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some
              cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social networking cookies:</strong> These cookies are used
              to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting
              on our website through third party social networking and other
              websites. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.

            You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in

            cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
            you with services.

            The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner

            use our website though your access to some functionality and areas
            of our website may be restricted.
